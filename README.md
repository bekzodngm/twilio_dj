# Twilio message sender

## Usage:
1) sign up at twilio https://www.twilio.com/. And open console, there you are going to see everything you need for your `.env` file (account_sid, authtoken)
2) copy **`.env.example`** as **`.env`** and paste all of your credentials from your twilio console.

If you want to send SMS messages for free, you should add the number you want to send to verified numbers at twilio. Dont remember how to do that, figure out yourself.
Run your server and hope you see the result!
